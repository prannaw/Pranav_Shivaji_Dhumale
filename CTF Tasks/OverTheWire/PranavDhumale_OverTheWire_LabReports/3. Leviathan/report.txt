Level 0 ➔ 1
Goal: Find the password by exploiting a simple executable.

How I Solved It:

Connected via SSH using the given credentials.

Listed the files using ls -la.

Found an executable that expected a password.

Used the strings command on the binary to reveal the correct password embedded inside.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 1 ➔ 2
Goal: Analyze a binary file requiring a PIN.

How I Solved It:

Ran ls to find the available programs.

Executed the given binary — it asked for a PIN.

Used strings again and found a hint or PIN inside.

Entered the correct PIN to get the password.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 2 ➔ 3
Goal: Discover password inside an executable.

How I Solved It:

Checked executable permissions using ls -l.

Ran the program and provided basic inputs.

Realized input validation was weak.

Input a negative number (like -1) to trigger unexpected behavior and reveal the password.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 3 ➔ 4
Goal: Manipulate program inputs.

How I Solved It:

Observed that the binary took input.

Gave an unusually large value as input.

Caused an overflow or unexpected reaction.

This made the binary print the password.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 4 ➔ 5
Goal: Crack simple password-checking program.

How I Solved It:

Located the binary.

Opened it with strings to find suspicious words.

Found a password hidden inside.

Used the password to move to the next user.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 5 ➔ 6
Goal: Exploit basic file permissions.

How I Solved It:

Spotted a program that required a password.

Used ltrace to trace library calls and see password comparisons.

Found the correct password when the binary checked it internally.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 6 ➔ 7
Goal: Understand how to control program flow.

How I Solved It:

Found the executable file.

Ran ltrace or gave unusual input.

Bypassed basic checks and made it reveal the final password.
