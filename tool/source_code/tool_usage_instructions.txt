Download url datasets from Kaggle or any other websites.
Make sure that the dataset has only two columns 'url' & 'type'.
The second column ('type') should only contain any of these four words: 'Benign', 'Phishing', 'Defacement' or 'Malware' for each url.
Make sure to save the dataset in the "source_code" folder and name the folder as 'url_dataset.csv'.
Open the terminal for the source code folder & type:
  python train_model.py  (This takes time to generate the report based on number of urls in the dataset csv file & generates a model.pkl in source_code folder) (max 2 minutes)
  python check_url.py    (This takes the user input url & classifies it correctly based on its type)
